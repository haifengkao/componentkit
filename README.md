ComponentKit is a view framework for iOS that is heavily inspired by React. It takes a functional, declarative approach to building UI. It was built to power Facebook's News Feed and is now used throughout the Facebook iOS app. 

It is abandoned by facebook long long time ago. I update it to be compatible with Xcode 16.3


### Quick start

```
  pod 'ComponentKit', :git => 'https://github.com/haifengkao/componentkit.git'
